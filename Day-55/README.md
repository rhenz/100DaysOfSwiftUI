## Day 55: Project 11 - Part 3

**Current Status:**  Done ✅

*https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/55*

>As we finish our app today, I hope you’re able to stop and realize just how much SwiftUI you already know. For example, to build the detail screen for our app will leverage Core Data, GeometryReader, VStack and ZStack, clip shapes, spacers, and more – things you should now be more than comfortable with, which shows how far you have come.
>
>Still, there are always new things to learn, which today will include how to delete Core Data objects, how to sort fetch requests using NSSortDescriptor, and how to add custom buttons to alerts. As the American philosopher Vernon Howard said, “Always walk through life as if you have something new to learn, and you will” – I drop in these small extra things into projects to keep you on your toes, but going over the old stuff is often just as important!
>
>Today you have three topics to work through, in which you’ll apply your new-found Core Data skills with List, @Binding, and more.

## What I have learned on this day:
- Showing book details
- Sorting fetch requests with NSSortDescriptor
- Deleting from a Core Data fetch request
- Using an alert to pop a NavigationLink programmatically
