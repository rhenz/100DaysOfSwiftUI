## Day 46: Project 8 - Part 4

**Current Status:**  Done ✅

*https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/46*

>We covered a huge amount of ground in this project, and you’ve learned about paths, shapes, strokes, transforms, drawing groups, animating values, and more. Not everyone will want to use all those features, and that’s OK – hopefully you have a clear idea of which parts interested you the most, and have some good coding experience with them.
>
>If you combine your new-found drawing abilities with all the animation functionality we covered back in project 6, I hope you’re starting to realize just how much power and flexibility SwiftUI gives us. Yes, you can of course create whole apps using List, NavigationView, and similar, but you can also build completely custom user interfaces that look fantastic and are just as fast.




## Challenges:
- Create an Arrow shape made from a rectangle and a triangle – having it point straight up is fine.
- Make the line thickness of your Arrow shape animatable.
- Create a ColorCyclingRectangle shape that is the rectangular cousin of ColorCyclingCircle, allowing us to control the position of the gradient using a property.
