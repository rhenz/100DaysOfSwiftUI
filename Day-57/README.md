## Day 57: Project 12 - Part 1

**Current Status:**  Done ✅

*https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/57*

>In this technique project we’re going to explore how Core Data and SwiftUI work together to help us build great apps. I already introduced you to the topic in project 11, but here we’re going to be going into more detail: custom managed object subclasses, ensuring uniqueness, and more.

>American entrepreneur Jim Rohn once said, “success is neither magical nor mysterious – success is the natural consequence of consistently applying the basic fundamentals.” Core Data is absolutely one of those basic fundamentals – you certainly won’t use it in every project, but understanding how it works and how to make the most of it will make you a better app developer.

## What I've Learned on this Day:
- Introduction to Core Data
- Why does \.self work for ForEach?
- Creating NSManagedObject subclasses
- Conditional saving of NSManagedObjectContext
- Ensuring Core Data objects are unique using constraints
