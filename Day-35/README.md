## Day 35: Milestone for Projects 4-6

**Current Status:**  In-Progress 🚧

> Your goal is to build an “edutainment” app for kids to help them
> practice multiplication tables – “what is 7 x 8?” and so on.
> Edutainment apps are educational at their code, but ideally have
> enough playfulness about them to make kids want to play.
>
> Breaking it down:
>
> - The player needs to select which multiplication tables they want to practice. This could be pressing buttons, or it could be an “Up to…”
> stepper, going from 1 to 12.
> - The player should be able to select how many questions they want to be asked: 5, 10, 20, or “All”.
> - You should randomly generate as many questions as they asked for, within the difficulty range they asked for. For the “all” case you
> should generate all possible combinations.
> - If you want to go fully down the “education” route then this is going to be some steppers, a text field and a couple of buttons. I
> would suggest that’s a good place to start, just to make sure you have
> the basics covered.
>
> Once you have that, it’s down to you how far you want to take the app
> down the “entertainment” route – you could throw away fixed controls
> like Stepper entirely if you wanted, and instead rely on colorful
> buttons to get the same result. You could use something like Kenney’s
> Animal Pack (which is public domain, by the way!) to add a fun theme
> to make it into a real game. And hopefully you will also add some over
> the top animations – it needs to appeal to kids 9 and under, so going
> bright, colorful, and perhaps even a bit zany is a good idea!
>
> To solve this challenge you’ll need to draw on skills you learned in
> all the projects so far, but if you start small and work your way
> forward you stand the best chance of success. At its core this isn’t a
> complicated app, so get the basics right and expand only if you have
> the time.
>
> At the very least, you should:
>
> Start with a Single View App template, then add some state to
> determine whether the game is active or whether you’re asking for
> settings. Because the app has two very different states – “we’re
> asking the user for settings” and “the game is running” – you should
> use a Group as your top-level view, so that some View always gets the
> same view type being sent back. Try and break up your layouts into new
> SwiftUI views, rather than putting everything in ContentView. Show the
> player how many questions they got correct at the end of the game,
> then offer to let them play again.
