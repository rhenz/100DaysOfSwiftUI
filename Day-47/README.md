## Day 46: Milestone: Projects 7-9

**Current Status:**  Done ✅

*https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/47*

>Congratulations on making it through another three projects! You’re probably feeling tired after our drawing technique project, but both today and tomorrow should be a good change of pace – today is a consolidation day, and tomorrow is something a little bit different.
>
>Today’s challenge is an interesting one, and honestly it has such a big potential to be developed into a larger app if you have the time. Days like today are important because they give you an idea that is wholly within your grasp, and give you the time and scope to execute on it. Hopefully you make the most of that – as the astronaut Mae Jemison once said, “I like to think of ideas as potential energy: they're really wonderful, but nothing will happen until we risk putting them into action.”
>
>So, today is an action day: you’ve got lots of coding ahead, plus the potential for more if you want to take the project further. Let’s get into it!




## Challenge:
>Before we move on to our next batch of projects, you have a fresh challenge to complete. This means building a complete app from scratch by yourself, using the skills you’ve acquired over the previous three projects.
>
>This time your goal is to build a habit-tracking app, for folks who want to keep track of how much they do certain things. That might be learning a language, practicing an instrument, exercising, or whatever – they get to decide which activities they add, and track it however they want.
>
>At the very least, this means there should be a list of all activities they want to track, plus a form to add new activities – a title and description should be enough.
>
>For a bigger challenge, tapping one of the activities should show a detail screen with the description, how many times they have completed it, plus a button incrementing their completion count.
>
>For an even bigger challenge, use Codable and UserDefaults to load and save all your data.
>
>So, there are three levels to this app, and you can choose how far you want to go depending on how much time you have and how far you want to push yourself. I do recommend you at least give each level a try, though – every little bit of practice you get helps solidify your learning!
