## Day 54: Project 11 - Part 2

**Current Status:**  Done ✅

*https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/54*

>Today we’re going to start applying the new techniques you learned to build our app, using Core Data to create books and a custom RatingView component to let users store how much they liked each book, built using @Binding.
>
>The way we handle data is critically important to our work. Sometimes it’s as simple as figuring out what should be a an integer and what should be a string; other times it requires a little theory, such as being able to choose between arrays and sets; and still other times it means we need to think about how objects relate to each other.
>
>A quote from Linus Torvalds that I love very much is this one: “Bad programmers worry about the code; good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.” I like it partly because it re-enforces the view that designing good data structures is critically important, but also because it’s a reminder that once you master one language it’s relatively easy to move to others – the syntax might be different, but the data structures are usually the same if not very similar.
>
>Today you have three topics to work through, in which you’ll apply your new-found Core Data skills with List, @Binding, and more.

## What I have learned on this day:
- Creating books with Core Data
- Adding a custom star rating component
- Building a list with @FetchRequest
